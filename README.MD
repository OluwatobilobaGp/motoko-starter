We're thrilled to introduce the Internet Computer, a remarkable innovation combining cryptography, math, computer science, and blockchain technology.
Despite the incredible technology we believe that the true value of a network lies in a passionate community, and during this Bootcamp, you'll learn from diverse developer mentors and contributors that are active member of the community, giving their time to make this event possible.

Our goal is to transmit both technical knowledge and enthusiasm for the Internet Computer as a force for a better future. We believe in its potential to create a fairer, more hopeful world, and hope the insights and connections you make this week contribute to that goal.

### 📞 Assistance 
This event is being run by volunteers and we have limited resources, we won't be able to answer all questions at all times considering that we have hundreds of students, please understand this fact and make sure to follow all instructions in the order provided. <br/>

When you need help, follow these steps in this order:

1. Dig into the list of resources, documentation and channels on Discord. Most likely the answer you need will be in here if you dig enough, and the more practice you get navigating the more effective and self-sufficient you'll be able to be as an Internet Computer developer.
2. Ask your team for help on Discord: collaboration is the key to the succcess.
3. Post in #ask-questions channel on Discord and ask your question by creating a new topic. Make sure your issue hasn't already been answered in another topic.
If you decide to create a new topic, please provide as much information as possible:
    - When did you encounter the issue?
    - What is the exact error message?
    - What have you already tried to deal with the problem?
    - Provide some screenshots to illustrate your request.
4. Join the next mentorship sessions.
5. You can ask for a Motoko Angel to assist you.

> 🚫 Do not spam the main channel of Discord with your issue, and avoid directly DM-ing organizers (expect Motoko-angels). Disruptive behavior that hinders the learning of other students will put you at risk of getting kicked out of the Bootcamp. We've never had to do this before, don't be the first.
