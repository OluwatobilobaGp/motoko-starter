# Day 3Ô∏è‚É£
## üéØ Goals of the day 
- Understand that mutable state cannot be shared between actors.
- Getting familiar with more advanced types: Optional & Generic types.
- Getting familiar with more advanced data structures: `HashMap`&`TrieMap`.
- Understand the concept of `Principal` and the context for understanding identity on the Internet Computer:
    - Digital signatures
    - Messages
    - The principal is derived from the PK.
- Understand how to interact with a canister from the front end:
    - Agent & Packages
    - Actor
    - The Candid files to JS
    - Calling the actor
