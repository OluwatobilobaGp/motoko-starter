# Day 3Ô∏è‚É£
Welcome to **Day 3** of the Motoko Bootcamp. As we near the middle of the week, we hope you're all advancing, acquiring new skills, and enjoying the journey. <br/>

Today, we'll address the essential building blocks for creating an application on the Internet Computer: CRUD operations and authentication. <br/>

It's vital to master the topics we'll explore today. If you need assistance, don't hesitate to reach out to your teammates or mentors. Remember, we're all here to learn, share a laugh, and support one another. üòâ

## üéØ Learning objectives
> **Before finishing your day**, review the following list and ensure that you have addressed each item on it. It's important that you have a clear understanding of all these concepts. <i> Why not try explaining them to one of your teammate to gauge your level of understanding? </i>

- Understand that mutable state cannot be shared between actors. 
- Getting familiar with more [advanced types](../../manuals/CHAPTER-8.MD#chapter-8-advanced-types) such: [Optional](../../manuals/CHAPTER-8.MD#optional-types) & [Generic types](../../manuals/CHAPTER-8.MD#üë§-generic-type).
- Getting familiar with using data structures such as: [HashMap](../../manuals/CHAPTER-6.MD#hashmap--triemap) or [TrieMap](../../manuals/CHAPTER-6.MD#hashmap--triemap).
- Understand the following concepts: 
- Understand the concept of [Principal](../../manuals/CHAPTER-) and being able to manipulate the type `Principal`
- Understand how to interact with a canister using the JavaScript agent and a frontend.  

> The Internet Computer reached 1 Billion blocks within 14 months of it's launch. It would take 18,0000 years for **Bitcoin** to get there. 

Good luck üçÄ
