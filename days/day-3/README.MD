# Day 3Ô∏è‚É£
Welcome to Day 4 of the Motoko Bootcamp! If you've been that far you're already an hero ü¶∏
We hope you are all making progress, learning new skills and not suffering too much. In the next few days you should spend more & more time into the core project - that's why the coding challenges & questions will be less important in this guide and the followings.

Today, we'll be diving deeper into more advanced topics in Motoko such as discussing the issues when upgrading a canister. üÜô
