# The Verifier 🧐
## Introduction
Imagine that you are an now an instructor at [Motoko School](), where you are currently overseeing a cohort of more than 200 dedicated students! <br/>
As part of the program, you have assigned these ambitious learners to tackle five distinct projects, each designed to challenge their skills and knowledge. Upon completion, it falls on your shoulders to meticulously review and evaluate their work, ultimately determining whether they have met the criteria for graduation. <br/>
Fortunately, as an adept Motoko developer yourself, you possess the expertise and confidence to streamline this verification process by leveraging automation. This innovative approach will not only save you valuable time but also pave the way for the future of **Motoko Bootcamp**.
## 🧑‍🏫 Requirements 
Your task is to create the code for a **verifier**, which is implemented as a canister. 
<br/> This canister should be able to verify that the interface of the projects you have created on the previous day corresponds to the requirements. To put it short you have the responsability of creating the system that will automatically verify your work... 🧐


## 📺 Interface
Your canister should implement the following interface:
```motoko
actor Verifier {

};
```
