# Day 3Ô∏è‚É£
Welcome to Day 3 of the Motoko Bootcamp.
We hope you're feeling like a coding ninja ready to take on even more advanced topics. Today, we'll learn how to interact with canisters from a front end using the JavaScript Agent. In addition, we'll also be introducing data structures such as `HashMap`/ `TrieMap` and CRUD operations. These data structures will be really useful when working on the project of the day.

Don't hesitate to ask for help from your teammates or mentors if you need it. Remember, we're all here to learn, have fun, and support each other. üòâ
