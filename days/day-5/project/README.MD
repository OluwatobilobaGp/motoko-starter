# MotoCoin 🪙
As your first week at the prestigious [Motoko School](https://twitter.com/MotokoSchool) comes to an end, you're in awe of the wealth of knowledge and collaborative spirit that surrounds you. The school is a hub of innovation and creativity, drawing the brightest minds from around the world to master the art of building on the Internet Computer. 

One evening, while exploring the school's virtual library, you stumble upon a hidden section filled with stories of the school's successful alumni. You're fascinated by their accomplishments, yet you notice a common theme: many have built incredible wealth, but only a few have given back to the school. 

At the same time, you overhear a conversation about the school's financial struggles and its inability to provide adequate resources for students in need. This revelation weighs heavily on your mind, and you feel compelled to find a solution that bridges the gap between the school's prosperous alumni and its underfunded programs. 💸

Inspired by the alumni stories, you envision a digital token that connects the past, present, and future of the Motoko School – the MotoCoin. This token would allow alumni and other investors to invest in the school's future while supporting its present needs. 🌱

You share your idea with a group of enthusiastic students, and together, you begin working tirelessly to bring MotoCoin to life. Built on the Internet Computer, following the latest ICRC standard, the Motoko Coin would be a decentralized and transparent ledger enabling investors, students, contributors to contribute to the school's growth and success.


## 🧑‍🏫 Requirements 
Your task is to create a ledger for a token that can be used as a currency for the school. The ledger is implemented as a canister and must follow the [ICRC_1](https://olm72-siaaa-aaaal-qbtpa-cai.ic0.app/internet-computer-standards/icrc1.html) standard.
