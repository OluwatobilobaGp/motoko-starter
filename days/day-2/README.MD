# Day 2Ô∏è‚É£
## üéØ Goals of the day 
- Understand what is the **Base** library, how to use it, and where to find the source code.
- Motoko: how to use the **Debug** module to test your code locally.
- Understand the concept of cycles & being able to top-up a canister using `dfx`.
- Understand how to manipulate control flow operators in Motoko: `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `switch/case`
- Getting familiar with primitive types in Motoko: `Text`, `Char` , `Float` & `Blob`.
- Getting familiar with simple data structures in Motoko: `Array` , `List` & `Buffer`.
- Getting familiar with more advanced types: Tuples, Object (custom) & variants.
- Overview of the biggest DAO on the Internet Computer: the **NNS**.
