# Day 2Ô∏è‚É£
Welcome back for **Day 2!** <br/>
We're thrilled to see you again and congrats on completing the first day. We hope you've had the opportunity to connect with your teammates and enjoyed the networking session. <br/>
Today, we'll delve deeper into the Motoko language with two specialized lectures and a new project. Let's dive in!
## üçø Lectures & events
> Be sure to consult the calendar for the precise schedule of each lecture.

| Title | Mentor |  Description |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
 Motoko: Array, List & Buffer | <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptoschindler" target="_blank"> Moritz </a> | This lectures covers the datastructures `Array`, `List` & `Buffer` and how to use them. 
| Motoko: Char, Text & Iter | <a href="https://twitter.com/seb_icp" target="_blank"> Seb  </a> | This lecture covers the types `Char` and `Text` in Motoko and explains how those are linked through the type `Iter`.

## üéØ Learning objectives
> **Before you finish your day**, review the following list and ensure that you have addressed each item on it. It's important that you have a clear understanding of all these concepts. <br/> <i> Why not try explaining them to one of your teammate to gauge your level of understanding? </i>

- Understand what is a [module](../../manuals/CHAPTER-5.MD#üß©-modules).
- Understand what is the [base library](../../manuals/CHAPTER-5.MD#üìö-the-base-library), [how to use it](../../manuals/CHAPTER-5.MD#importing-from-the-base-library) and where to find the [source code](https://github.com/dfinity/motoko-base). 
- Understand how to use the [Debug module](../../manuals/appendix/APPENDIX-7.MD#debugging) to test your code locally.
- Understand how to manipulate [control flow operators](../../manuals/CHAPTER-2.MD#üïπÔ∏è-control-flow) in Motoko: `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `switch/case`
- Getting familiar with more primitive types in Motoko: `Text`, `Char` & the unit type.
- Getting familiar with simple data structures in Motoko: [Array](../../manuals/CHAPTER-6.MD#üóÉÔ∏è-array) , [List](../../manuals/CHAPTER-6.MD#list) & [Buffer](../../manuals/CHAPTER-6.MD#ü•û-buffer).
- Getting familiar with more advanced types: [Tuples](../../manuals/CHAPTER-7.MD#üëØ-tuple) and [Objects](../../manuals/CHAPTER-7.MD#üé®-objects).
- Understand [what is DAO](../../manuals/appendix/APPENDIX-2.MD#üèõÔ∏è-decentralized-autonomous-organization-a-new-model-of-governance), how it can be used and how the Internet Computer enables [new usecases](../../manuals/appendix/APPENDIX-2.MD#üöÄ-from-smart-contracts-to-canisters) for those organisations.
- Being familiar with the [Network Nervous System](../../manuals/appendix/APPENDIX-4.MD#appendix-4-network-nervous-system-nns).

> Before deciding to call it **Motoko**, the language developed by **DFINITY** for programming actors on the Internet Computer was actually called **ActorScript**.
