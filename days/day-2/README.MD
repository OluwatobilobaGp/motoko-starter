# Day 2️⃣
Welcome back for **day 2**! We're super excited to have you back and congratulations on making it through the first day. We also hope you had the chance to get to know your teammates and connect. 
Today, we're diving into a bit more into the **Motoko** language with two dedicated lectures. You'll be writing more code than yesterday, so get ready to put your knowledge to the test.

## 🎯 Goals of the day 


## 🎯 Learning objectives
> **Before you finish your day**, review the following list and ensure that you have addressed each item on it. It's important that you have a clear understanding of all these concepts. <br/> <i> Why not try explaining them to one of your teammate to gauge your level of understanding? </i>

- Understand what is a [module](../../manuals/CHAPTER-5.MD#🧩-modules).
- Understand what is the [base library](../../manuals/CHAPTER-5.MD#📚-the-base-library), [how to use it](../../manuals/CHAPTER-5.MD#importing-from-the-base-library) and where to find the [source code](https://github.com/dfinity/motoko-base). 
- Understand the concept of [cycles](../../manuals/CHAPTER-1.MD#fuel-on-the-internet-computer-cycles) & being able to top-up a **canister**.
- Understand how to use the [Debug module](../../manuals/appendix/APPENDIX-7.MD#debugging) to test your code locally.
- Understand the difference between [update](../../manuals/CHAPTER-1.MD#update-vs-query) & [query](../../manuals/CHAPTER-1#update-vs-query) calls.
- Understand the differences between a variable declared with [let](../../manuals/CHAPTER-2.MD#📦-variables) & [var](../../manuals/CHAPTER-2.MD#📦-variables).
- Understand what is [Candid](../../manuals/CHAPTER-4.MD#chapter-4-candid-the-language-of-the-internet-computer) & how to use the [Candid UI](../../manuals/CHAPTER-4.MD#📲-candid-ui) to interact with your API.
- Understand that Motoko is a typed language and become familiar with the basic types: [Nat](../../manuals/CHAPTER-3.MD#🔢-nat), [Int](../../manuals/CHAPTER-3.MD#➖-int) & [Bool](../../manuals/CHAPTER-3.MD#🚦-bool).
- Being comfortable deploying, managing and interacting with canisters through [dfx](../../manuals/CHAPTER-4/#📺-using-the-terminal-dfx).
- Understand how to manipulate control flow operators in Motoko: `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `switch/case`
- Getting familiar with primitive types in Motoko: `Text`, `Char` , `Float` & `Blob`.
- Getting familiar with simple data structures in Motoko: `Array` , `List` & `Buffer`.
- Getting familiar with more advanced types: Tuples, Object (custom) & variants.
- Overview of the biggest DAO on the Internet Computer: the **NNS**.

> The gift of knowledge is the highest gift in the world.

Good luck 🍀
