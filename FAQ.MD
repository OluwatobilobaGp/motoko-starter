# FAQ 🙋
## General 
### What is the Internet Computer?
The Internet Computer is an innovative decentralized computing platform that was created by [DFINITY](https://dfinity.org/), a non-profit organization based in Switzerland 🇨🇭. <br/>
The platform opens up new possibilities by allowing developers to build full-stack applications directly on the blockchain.
Contrary to other platforms like Ethereum that relies on the cloud to host web-applications, the Internet Computer hosts [canisters](./manuals/CHAPTER-1.MD#what-is-a-canister) which enables storage on-chain & access to the canister directly from a browser. For instane, the website of Motoko Bootcamp is hosted entirely on the Internet Computer.
At Motoko Bootcamp, we strongly believe that the Internet Computer is the future of Web3 and has immense potential.
### What is Motoko?
Motoko is a pretty cool name. 👻 <br/>
It is also a new programming language that was developed specifically for the Internet Computer. If you are familiar with JavaScript or Solidity, you'll find that it looks very similar.
Learning Motoko will enable you to build any Web3 application and find a job in the field (Motoko developers are in high demands due to the growing number of applications running on the Internet Computer).
Basically, learning this language early on will give you a huge advantage.

Hello! My name is [Seb](https://twitter.com/seb_icp) and I'm super excited about the Internet Computer and how it can change the world. I actually left school to pursue this passion, and now I create educational content and organize Bootcamps so that others can get started too. <br/>
I also wanted to let you know that Motoko Bootcamp is hosted by [Code & State](https://twitter.com/codeandstate), a studio that specializes in creating startups and forming entrepreneurs on the Internet Computer - this is where I work. <br/>
We believe the next wave of entrepreneurs is going to build on the Internet Computer and our main goal is to make it easy for other people to build and earn money on the platform. Motoko Bootcamp is a really important part of that.
